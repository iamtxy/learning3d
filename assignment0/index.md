# Task 1 
**Prompt**
```
Write a song/poem/story/joke.
```
**Answer from GPT** 
```
Got it 🙂 Here’s a playful short poem for you:

The Coffee and the Moon

The moon asked the coffee,
“Why do you steam?”
Coffee replied,
“To wake up the dream.”

The stars giggled softly,
The sun hid a yawn,
And the sleepy old world
Kept on spinning along.

So sip what you’re given,
Be it starlight or brew—
For dreams need a waking,
And mornings need you.

Want me to try one in a funny joke style instead, or keep it lyrical like this?
```
